#Andrea

Yes, another front-end framework. Sue me.

Demo: [Andrea](http://oelizondo.github.io/Andrea/)

##What does it come with?

###A 12-column grid

```html

  <div class="one"></div>
  <div class="two"></div>
  <div class="three"></div>
  <div class="four"></div>
  <div class="five"></div>
  <div class="six"></div>
  <div class="seven"></div>
  <div class="eight"></div>
  <div class="nine"></div>
  <div class="ten"></div>
  <div class="eleven"></div>
  <div class="twelve"></div>

  <div class="row"></div>

  <div class="container"></div>

```

###Some buttons

```html
  <div class="button"></div>
  <div class="ghost"></div>
  <div class="big button"></div>
```

###Some base styles

Base styles have been included for the ```<hr>```, anchors and headings.
Andrea comes with normalize as well.

###Some rules

These rules are to make life easier, for exampls ```<div class="landing-height"></div>``` will create a dive that has 100vh height to make landing websites easier.

###Version

Andrea is in version 0.0.1, or in an alpha stage. The main framework is done, but I expect to add layers of functionality in the future.

###Rationale

No we don't need another web framework, and no I don't care. It was fun. That's it. And I'm not finished with it.
